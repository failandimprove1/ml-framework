Introduction
------------

This project is a framework for machine learning and data science. It will ideally provide the necessary tools to make small machine learning programs. 
The framework is written with c++ and compiles natively to all platforms.

You can build the libraries or download the binaries.
There are no external libraries or dependancies, which makes it very lightweight and easy to build / download.

Installation
------------
This is how to install the program and run it. 
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/failandimprove1/ml-framework/
```

Windows
----
2. Compile the program with Makefile
```bash
make
```
3. Execute the program
```bash
bin/main.exe
```
Linux
----
2. Compile the program with Makefile
```bash
make main-linux
```
3. Execute the program
```bash
chmod +x bin/main
bin/main
```
